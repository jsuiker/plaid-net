# Plaid
###### .NET bindings for the Plaid API

This library provides convenient access to the [Plaid restful services](https://plaid.com/docs/). It's also available as [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Plaid/) for .NET and Universal Windows Platform. Please [drop me a note](https://github.com/tmarkovski/plaid-net/issues) if you need specific target frameworks.
